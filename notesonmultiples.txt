I can include various files using #include "file.asm"


When the compiler outputs something, it'll generate an .asm file for each thing.

Currently, we do not support multiple files in either the assembler or the compiler.

The compiler will generate each thing individually and output a seperate assembly file for each the first caommand line being the entrypoint
	(this means nothing to the compiler, other than to feed this file as the first one into the assembler and generate an entrypoint call to main),
	whereas the assembler will grab that input, treat the first input on the command line as the *entrypoint* for the resulting "executable"

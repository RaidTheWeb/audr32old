Finally!

Completed all arithmetic functions, stack operations, I/O and jumps. Everything *but* signed arithmetic is implemented from the spec.

There's still quite a bit I want to add to the CPU and the assembler respectively.

	- Assembler:
		- Formatting bugs with the Lexer
		- Macros
		- Sections (.text, .data)
			- asciiz, byte, incbin, etc.
		- Inline arithmetic (+-/*)
		- Constants (piggy back off the label logic, probably)
		- Improve pointers
			- Allow offsets to data (ie. [8:bp:-1] to reference the byte before the base pointer register's value)
	- CPU:
		- Better flag handling
		- Better I/O (BUS?)
		- Allow offsets to a pointer address reference (dynamic with registers, likely just add a "offset" parameter to the pointer in binary)

That's all for tonight!

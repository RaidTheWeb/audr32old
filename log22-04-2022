Massive improvements to the entire system

- Improve clock system to allow for *much* faster speeds
- Make screen rendering efficient and ensure it remains at a cool 60 FPS (SDL2) without comprimising speed of the CPU.

Minor improvements

- Fix a few bugs with the generic flow of the system
- Refactor debug printing (now prints after cycles (could be a problem if more accurate readings are required?))
- Implement `$` (jump to current instruction)

Other shit:

- Make another shitty test for an Operating System

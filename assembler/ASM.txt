# Audr32 Assembler Specification

**Audr32 (Audrey) Assembly** (A32ASM) is a simple assembler targetting the Audr32 (Audrey) computer architecture.

A32ASM supports general assembly operations as well as Macros and other modern features.


## Output file structure:

+-------------------------------+
| Text Area (Code Section)      | Anchored at 0x00004000
+-------------------------------+
| Static Area (Data Section)    | Starts after code section. (Just before it exists a JMP instruction to the start of the code section to avoid interpreting data without explicitly telling the CPU to do so)
+-------------------------------+

Code section supports all generic instructions and directives.

Data section contains defined data such as:
    - Strings (.ascii, .asciiz (.string))
    - Numbers (.number)
    - Binary Data (.byte)

    (Interrupt table would usually be created in the data section)


## Macro Directives:

Macros are declared by a single `@` symbol at the start of a line. Valid macros include the following:

- @define name value                        - Declare a constant value (is not reflected in code whatsoever)
- @include path                             - Include another A32ASM file at current interpretation point.
- @if(n)def name                            - Encapsulate check if a constant is (not) defined or a constant expression resolves to a respective value.
    - @else                                 - If otherwise
- @endif                                    - End an @if(n)def Macro Directive
- @global                                   - Export declarative value (data, subroutine, etc.)

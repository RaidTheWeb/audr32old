Macros are now implemented!

Constants can be defined and so can the "origin", the latter of which just changes the current position of emitted data.

Sections are now implemented!

The user can now define a .text section (for code) and a .data section (for raw binary data).

    .data section operators include:

        - .byte <data>              (insert a single 8 bit integer)
        - .word <data>              (insert a single 16 bit integer)
        - .dword <data>             (insert a single 32 bit integer)
        - .ascii <string>           (insert a string with now null termination)
        - .asciiz/.string <string>  (insert a null terminated string)

Next Steps:

Iron out bugs, improve instruction set, trial SubC

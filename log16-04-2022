Completely overhauled the entire display and human interface system!

- Allowed the usage of bitmap fonts of most specifications (built-in grabbed from `cword` (my OS project) )

- Implemented graphics functions such as:
    - Teletype per-character output
    - String output
    - Pixel drawing
    - Colour indexes (Bit like VGA colours)
- Overhauled the keyboard system, it now abides by a buffer system supports proper interrupts to gather data *and* supports ASCII conversions.

- Added incbin macro to assembler, so now the user may include a binary file exclusively inside a .data section

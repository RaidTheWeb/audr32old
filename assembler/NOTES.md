# funny notes so I can remember things.

- Files are compiled/assembled first, outputting their raw binary forms, then linked together to create the output binary file.
    - Output file is relocated (symbols are resolved) during linking.
- Images are the output file :troll:
    - Images can be used in the VM (Emulator) to run code.

- Ha, your'e mother.

- Implement better handling of newlines at the end of certain statements. 
	- Labels now work inline
- Implement `#include "file.asm"` and refactor entire system for assembling files.
	- Assembling is now seperate from relocating and emitting, meaning multiple files may be "merged" before final linking.
- Realise making signed instructions is useless, as unsigned instructions will produce an identical outcome.
    - Implement signed integers into assembler *properly* via a simple change to the lexer
